Hello folk,

This might be the weirdest story you’ve ever heard, but before we dive in the story let me give you a quick introduction about me.

A 21 years old guy called Zouhir Yacouri and i’m currently living in 📍 Morocco, especially in Rabat ( the capital ).

Alrighty, So the story is about my relation with programming and how did i start coding the first time ever.

## How did i start programming ?

It’s all started when i was 17 years old, as usual i was hanging out with my friend in order to have fun and talk about random topics. After taking a long nice walk we sat in a garden to continue our conversation about gaming and pc’s building because both of us we’re addicted to video games 🎮.

Then guess what happened, a street light pole turned on automatically and i was surprised like “huh 🤔?” who turned on ? how ? I have never paid attention to things like this, also never asked questions like these especially in technology but the time has come to discover what’s behind the scenes 😎.

Oh yea here the adventure begins, i took the chance then i asked my friend how the street light pole works and how they turn On/Off ⚡ automatically. Would you like to explain please?

My friend said umm Okay caveman let me explain to you how does it work, so basically they rely on a device called a photoresistor to turn them on and off, and it requires the presence or the absence of light in other to flip the switch, so with the first morning rays of sunlight the photo resistor senses the presence of light and becomes conductive to electricity. And when the darkness falls so the photoresistor becomes a poor conductor of electricity and Tadaaaa 🎩 the lights turn on.

i was like:

Ooooh interesting i really want to learn technologies like this ,but is it hard to program things like this in order to implement a mini project and discover how things works.

He said there are no secrets nothing is easy, but it’s worth spending time learning stuffs like this and mark my words you won’t regret taking this decision.

I went home and i took time to think about the decision i’m going to make. and the result was ‘Let’s give it a try, who knows it might be worthy’.

So the first thing i googled is “How to program things automatically”, i have clicked on the first search result that appears on my screen, and guess what… a bunch of lines of code, i was like Woaaah ( you know first impression when you see code you start thinking about hacking and stuffs like that 👾👽 …) even if i don’t understand a single line of the code it gave me more motivation to search in this area. I just wanted learn ASAP, but of course this is a bad idea to start with. and i remembered that my friend said it’s worth spending time learning.

I kept searching in this area day by day but to be honest i was random because i had exams and a lot of homework to do from the school, i decided to make a schedule with the aim of improving my self. It was hard but yeah i did it for the love of the first impression 😂.

## From caveman to hackerman.

Here come the hacker man 💻. I couldn’t by courses or anything because i was broke, so the only solution was Youtube 📺. I found a video that explains the road map of programming and it’s different pillars.

Therefore i started watching a playlist of Python programming language because it was the most recommended language for beginners (these results are based on my personal researches). Day by day improving my self and taking notes, to be honest it was a bit hard mostly when i was facing errors that i have never seen before but it’s funny at the same time because i’m learning new things 😍.

After 1 month of learning and practicing Python programming i became able to create basic applications. i can’t describe how happy i am after realizing simple applications, and i was so proud of my self even my friend has stopped telling me caveman after this.

My next step in Python was to master the O.O.P ( Object oriented programming ) because it was a nightmare for me.

Replaying the videos more than 3 times, errors, practice, 0 projects ideas … Man this was so boring but had to be consistent. I start grasping how it works and the happiness comes again 👏🏽.

My second project was to create an application to solve my science homework, it was a good experience working on it but again the hardest part is errors and how to structure things. But i did it and i started flexing on my classmates 😂💪🏽.

Of course you know what comes after that when your classmates knows that you can write code and stuffs, The most famous line “Yo bro can you hack Facebook accounts ?”.

Like how funny are these people 🤣, whatever let’s forget about them.

I started falling in love with python especially when i discovered that i can make GUI applications (Graphic User Interface) with Python using a library named “Tkinter”, starting with the basics and taking notes but this time it was less boring and A LOT OF FUN. I made a lot of applications with “Tkinter” it was a good library and friendly.

## For you 💖🎁
As a conclusion i would like to say, don’t be scared of new things in your life, keep the good vibes on and go for it, whatever comes to you give it a try of course if it is not harmful. and don’t forget consistency is the key guys, whatever it takes keep pushing until u get what you want 🎁.

I hope you enjoy reading my weird story with programming. Next blog i will talk about the story with my IT teacher when i was in the college.

Love you guys. Yacouri was here.
