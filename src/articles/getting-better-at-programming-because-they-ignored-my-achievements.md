## My achievements 🏆
After spending more than 4 months of learning and practicing Python i became able to create many mini-projects, i was so proud of my self and always thinking that i’m the only one in the college who knows coding etc…

And this one of the reasons why my ego went up 📈 so far . It’s good to be proud of your own achievements and having a stable ego, but you have to be careful and always remember that you have to adopt the student mindset to avoid the ego.

Anyway my latest project was a “World General Culture”, i worked so hard for this project here is an image of the application :

I wrote a small documentation for the game in order to share it with MITT, but i forgot that my application isn’t executable because if she want to try the game she has to install Python + Tkinter etc …

So once again here comes the hacker man of me 😂, my mission was to convert the code into executable file so she can use it as a normal application. this was the hardest part because i was kind of bad at searching for such things like that. After 2 days ⏰ of suffering i finally found a video that explains the whole process, i followed step by step and Tadaaa 🎇 everything is working fine.

my next todo was going to MITT and present the application to her, but i was kind of shy to face her because i have never done this before, then i was like come on man it makes no sense to be shy for things like this GOOO FOR IT your not a caveman anymore😂.

On the next day when i finished my classes i went to talk with MITT, you know casual conversation Hi, how are you doing bla bla bla… then i told her about the application and the language i used, she was like :

> Python? naah i don’t know what is this but you can install the >application on my laptop i will check it later.

Now you might have the same question as me 🤔, She is an IT teacher but she has no idea about the new technologies etc… But who cares the mission has been completed successfully 🏆.

## Me getting totally ignored 😓

![Ignored](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*spVpRO-izeHdqUZ0)

The hacker sad man is waiting all the time for the feedback from MITT but she didn’t contact me at all, i went to her just to remind her and she said “Oh i forgot about it… will try it soon don’t worry 😄”. I was like yeah no problem take your time 😄.

Once again i’m getting totally ignored, no feedback. And Here comes the self-doubt, i start doubting my skills, asking my self what have i done? am i unskilled ? is my application not good enough ? To be honest this time i got mad, and i promised my self that won’t remind her because i hate forcing things because it will have less value. Couldn’t resist this mood i had to take a decision to get better.

To be honest it hurts when u get ignored twice, but I realized that people might have other things with high priority to do in real life.

I promised my self to work more and get better at coding for me not for others and no matter what i release i have to control my ego in order to keep it stable.

## Meeting MITT AGAIN 😳?
![Meeting my teacher again!](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*9V4_krCh7JXkzURP)

I was sitting in my fav coffeeshop working on my personal project until MITT showed up from nowhere. I saw here and i was like “Huh 😳? is that MITT from the college?”.

I went to her and i said “Hi teacher”. She smiled in my face and she said: “Hey, i saw you outside and your face seems familiar to me 🤔” Then i knew that she recognized me and i said yesss i am that guy who asked for the application’s feedback.

We kept talking about college memories and new, she asked about my career and i told her everything. She was happy and proud of me and she encouraged me to continue in this path. At the end of the conversation she asked about my number because sometimes she need someone to present new technologies and talk about IT area.

What a great coincidence meeting MITT again, it was a good conversation between us.
